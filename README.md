# SchrodingerSolver
### C++ code for calculating the energy eigenvalues of the Schrodinger equation.
This code has been used in the paper [Analysis of the ground-state energy eigenvalues of fractal quantum potentials](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ab2b6d) by Alireza Hashemi and Amirhossein Darooneh.
Two methods have been implemented in this code: The Numerov finite difference method and the novel annalytical transfer matrix method, for which the description is available in the published paper.
